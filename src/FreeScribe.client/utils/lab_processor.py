def generate_lab_hl7(text, testing=False):
    """
    Extracts laboratory test results from a given text and formats them into HL7 OBX segments.
    This function scans the input text for known laboratory analytes, extracts their corresponding values,
    and generates HL7 OBX segment strings for each found analyte. It avoids duplicate entries by only
    processing the first occurrence of each analyte. The mapping of analyte names to HL7 codes and units
    is predefined within the function.

    Args:
    -----
        text (str): The input text containing laboratory test results, typically from an OCR process.
        testing (bool, optional): Boolean flag that returns an annotated hl7, making easier to identify result names
    
    Returns:
    --------
        str: A string containing HL7 OBX segments for each extracted laboratory test result, one per line.
    
    Notes:
    ------
        - Only the first occurrence of each analyte is processed.
        - The function handles values with inequalities ('<' or '>') and ranges ('-').
        - Analytes with 'N/A' as their HL7 code are skipped.
        - The function is tailored to a specific set of analytes and may require updates for new tests.
