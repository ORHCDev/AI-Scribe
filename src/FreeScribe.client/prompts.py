the category type is 'Advertisement'. If the confidence level percentage is less than 60% for the category type 'Advertisement', then
go to next step. 

Step b. If there is only one category to select from, select that category as the document category.
If there is more that one category to select from go to next step.

Step c. Identify the top two document categories based on their confidence level percentage.

Step d. If the top two categories are "Consult" and "Notification", and both have confidence levels above 60%, select "Consult" as the document category. Else go to next step.

Step 3. If the top two categories are "Requisition" and "Radiology", and both have confidence levels below 60%, select "Miscellaneous" as the document category. Else go to next step.

Step f. If the confidence level difference between the top two categories is less than 15%, select "Miscellaneous" as the document category. Else go to next step.

Step g. If neither of the above conditions apply, select the top document category with the highest confidence level percentage.
