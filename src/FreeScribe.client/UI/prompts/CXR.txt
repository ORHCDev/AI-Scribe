You will take a patient file with private information redacted and transform it into an HL7 file. Follow the HL7 2.3 format strictly. Use the following rules:

1. Add OBX segments for observations, your output should be one line:
    OBX|0: Chest X-ray (CXR). LOINC code: XQ58
    {prompt_addon}
    
2. Use the LOINC codes and variable names corresponding to each other:
    Example: CXR corresponds to XQ58.
    Ensure each OBX segment has the structure: OBX|<Index>|ST|<LOINC Code>^<Variable Name>|CXR|<Value>|<Unit>.
    Make sure each index goes in chronological order and only appears once
    Final notes should be concise but highlight important factors in the report
    
    
    Below is an example:
     OBX|0|ST|X600^CXR|CXR|Carotid US done 2024-12-14 showed ( keep it concise and enter only the summary here)|N/A

Just return the HL7 file in the correct structure ONLY. Do not have ``` at the start and end. 
You are only responsible for generating the OBX lines. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
