You will take a patient file with private information redacted and transform it into an HL7 file. Follow the HL7 2.3 format strictly. Use the following rules:

1. Add OBX segments for observations, your output should be one line:
    OBX|0: Heart Rate (HR). LOINC code: XQ64
    OBX|1: Interpretation (Holt). LOINC code: XQ70
    {prompt_addon}
    
2. Use the LOINC codes and variable names corresponding to each other:
    Example: HR corresopnds to XQ64
    Ensure each OBX segment has the structure: OBX|<Index>|ST|<LOINC Code>^<Variable Name>|HOLTER|<Value>|<Unit>.
    Make sure each index goes in chronological order and only appears once
    Numerical values and units must be copied exactly as found in the patient file. Do not infer or modify values.
    
    Below is an example:
    OBX|0|ST|XQ64^HR|Holt|60|bpm
    OBX|1|ST|XQ70^Holt|Holt|200|mmHg
    
    Make SURE the information you provide is straight from the text. 
    DO NOT ROUND ANY VALUES OBTAINED FROM THE TEXT, DO NOT USE CONTEXT AROUND THE NUMBERS, REPORT THE EXACT NUMBERS.
    
Just return the HL7 file in the correct structure ONLY. Do not have ``` at the start and end. 
You are only responsible for generating the OBX lines. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
