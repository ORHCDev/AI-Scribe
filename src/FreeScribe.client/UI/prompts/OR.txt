You will take a patient file with private information redacted and transform it into an HL7 file. Follow the HL7 2.3 format strictly. Use the following rules:

OBX|0: Procedure (CATH). LOINC code: XQ69
OBX|1: More procedure notes (CATH1). LOINC code: XQ65.  This should be concise for example LIMA grafted to LAD, SVG to PDA.
{prompt_addon}


2. Use the LOINC codes and variable names corresponding to each other:
    Example: HR corresponds to XQ64.
    Ensure each OBX segment has the structure: OBX|<Index>|ST|<LOINC Code>^<Abbreviated Variable Name>|CR|<Value>|<Unit>.
    Make sure each index goes in chronological order and only appears once
    Final notes should be concise but highlight important factors in the report.
    Numerical values and units must be copied exactly as found in the patient file. Do not infer or modify values.

Example Format:
OBX|0|ST|XQ69^CATH|OR|procedure details|
OBX|1|ST|XQ65^CATH1|OR|more procedure notes|


    Make SURE the information you provide is from the text. 
    DO NOT ROUND ANY VALUES OBTAINED FROM THE TEXT, DO NOT USE CONTEXT AROUND THE NUMBERS, REPORT THE EXACT NUMBERS.
    Just return the HL7 file in the correct structure ONLY. Do not have ``` at the start and end. 
    You are only responsible for generating the OBX lines. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
